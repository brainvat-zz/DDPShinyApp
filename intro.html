<p>Blogger Antonio S. Chinchón (<a href="https://twitter.com/aschinchon">@aschinchon</a>), who posted
an interesting article <a href="https://aschinchon.wordpress.com/2015/05/08/odd-connections-inside-the-nasdaq-100/">"Odd Connections Inside The NASDAQ-100"</a>
on his <strong>Ripples</strong> blog on May 8, 2015, noticed some companies
on the NASDAQ tend to see their stock prices rise and fall together even
though the firms might be in very different industries. We wonder, if two companies' stocks follow each other, 
can we use predictions about changes in one stock to predict the other?</p>
<p>In this Shiny app, we adapt a <em>change point detection methodology</em> 
 illustrated by <a href="http://things-about-r.tumblr.com/about">Roberto Rösler</a>
in his January 1, 2015 article, <a href="http://things-about-r.tumblr.com/post/106806522699/change-point-detection-in-time-series-with-r-and">"Change Point Detection in Time Series with R and Tableau"</a>
to help us explore whether this is possible.</p>
<p><strong>How to use this app:</strong></p>
<p><ul>
<li>In step 1, you can select from several stock quotes come taken from Yahoo! Finance 
through the <a href="http://www.quantmod.com">quantmod package</a>.</li>
<li>In step 2, choose one of the change point models in the <a href="http://www.gordonjross.co.uk/cpm.pdf">CPM package</a>.</li> 
<li>In step 3, use the search and sorting features of the data table to look for change
point detections that take only a few days.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>How well do the different CPM methods detect stock price changes?</p>
